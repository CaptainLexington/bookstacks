<h2>About Bookstacks Online</h2>

<p>Bookstacks Online is a simple web page for tracking your position in several series of books at one time</p>

<h3>Why Bookstacks?</h3>
<p>
I don't know about anybody else, but when <em>I</em> get involved a book series, I don't often read all of them in a row. Sometimes several months elapse between two installments in a series, because life, work, or, most often, other books get in the way. I like to be able to easily figure out what the next book in the series is. I'd like to be able to do this for all the series I'm reading at any time!

<h3>But why Bookstacks <em>specifically</em></h3>
<p>
Like, rather than, say <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads?</a> GoodReads has a lot of information about just about every book ever published, but their interface for tracking books to read and books you've read is very clunky. Although I used GoodReads to track my reading progress last year, I found my to-read shelf had gotten entirely out of date. Bookstacks eschews detailed book information (you supply the titles, and that's it!) for a drop-dead simple, extremely intuitive, and immediately useful interface.

<h3>Why not a To-Do list application?</h3>
<p>
This is essentially a very, <em>very</em> minimal To-Do list application.

<h3>So why?</h3>
<p>
Shut up, it's my website.
